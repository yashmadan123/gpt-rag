3. **Content Filtering**: Custom Bing Search provides the ability to filter out unwanted content, ensuring that search results meet the quality and relevance standards set by the organization.
4. **Improved Relevance and Ranking**: By customizing the ranking of search results, businesses can ensure that the most important and relevant information is prioritized, improving the overall efficiency of the search process.
5. **Enhanced Control**: Businesses have more control over the search experience, allowing them to tailor the search functionality to better serve their users' needs and expectations.

In summary, Custom Bing Search empowers organizations to deliver a more effective and efficient search experience by customizing the search parameters to align with their specific needs and priorities. This leads to improved user satisfaction and better utilization of information resources.

### **BING Deployment Procedure**

1. Create Custom Bing Services from Azure Portal
2. Once the service is created go to the following site: https://www.customsearch.ai/ click Sign In in top right and create a new instance. 
3. Add the URLs that I need to include for my solution, make sure to order the ranking of the results using the arrows.
4. Click on Publish and that will generate the CustomCustomConfigID.
5. Open the Azure Key Vault located in the Resource Group of GPT-RAG and add the following secrets: (bingAPIKey & bingCustomConfigID)
6. Create/Update the following Environment Variables under the Orchestrator:
    1. "BING_SEARCH_TOP_K": 3 (Top 3 Results from Bing)
    2. "BING_RETRIEVAL":"true"
    3. "RETRIEVAL_PRIORITY": "bing" (If you have multiple sources you are prioritizing the Bing as first query)
    4. "BING_SEARCH_MAX_TOKENS": "1000"
7. Once is done you can open the Orchestrator Log Stream from Azure Portal in order to confirm the retrieval are coming from the sites.

# SQL Integration Queries as Natural Language

SQL Integration is a service that allows users to seamlessly connect and query their SQL databases. This service enhances the capabilities of GPT-RAG by enabling the retrieval and analysis of structured data from various SQL databases.

### Benefits of SQL Integration:

1. **Custom Queries**: SQL Integration allows users to create custom queries to extract specific data points, ensuring that the information retrieved is highly relevant to their needs.
   
2. **Analytical Functions**: Users can perform various analytical functions such as count, sum, average, min, and max, enabling detailed insights and data analysis directly from the database.
   
3. **Data Aggregation**: SQL Integration supports data aggregation and grouping, which helps in summarizing large datasets and extracting meaningful patterns and trends.
   
4. **Real-Time Data Access**: By integrating with SQL databases, users can access real-time data, ensuring that the responses generated are based on the most current information available.
   
5. **Enhanced Data Management**: The service allows for efficient data management and retrieval, helping organizations maintain a well-organized and easily accessible data repository.

### **SQL Deployment Procedure**

Currently the integration is performed by SQL User & Password. 

1. **Add/Update Environment Variable**: ""RETRIEVAL_PRIORITY": "sql" in the Orchestrator Function.
2. **Add/Update Environment Variable**: "SQL_TOP_K": "3" in the Orchestrator Function.
3. **Add/Update Environment Variable**: "SQL_MAX_TOKENS": "1000" in the Orchestrator Function.
4. **Add the following secrets** in the Azure Key Vault: "sqlpassword" and enter the password for the SQL Authentication.
5. **Copy the following example in the code_orchestrator.py** in order to perform the query.
6. **Test Connectivity** perform a GET using Postman with the following params:
```json
   'sql_search': sql_search,
   'sql_server': sql_server,
   'sql_database': sql_database,
   'sql_table_info': sql_table_info,
   'sql_username': sql_username,
   'sql_top_k': sql_top_k,
```
